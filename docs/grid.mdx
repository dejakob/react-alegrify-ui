# Grid

import { Playground } from 'docz';
import Grid from '../lib/grid';
import GridCell from '../lib/grid-cell';
import Section from '../lib/section';

Based on a 12 column grid system.
Adding `six` will give a 50% width, because 6/12 = 50%.

## Example

<Playground>
    <Grid
        all
    >
        <GridCell
            six
        >
            <Section>Cell 1</Section>
        </GridCell>
        <GridCell
            six
        >
            <Section>Cell 2</Section>
        </GridCell>

        <GridCell
            four
        >
            <Section>Cell 3</Section>
        </GridCell>
        <GridCell
            four
        >
            <Section>Cell 4</Section>
        </GridCell>
        <GridCell
            four
        >
            <Section>Cell 5</Section>
        </GridCell>

        <GridCell
            three
        >
            <Section>Cell 6</Section>
        </GridCell>
        <GridCell
            three
        >
            <Section>Cell 7</Section>
        </GridCell>
        <GridCell
            three
        >
            <Section>Cell 8</Section>
        </GridCell>
        <GridCell
            three
        >
            <Section>Cell 9</Section>
        </GridCell>
    </Grid>
